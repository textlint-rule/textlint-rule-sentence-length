```
{
    "rules": {
        "sentence-length": {
            "max": 100
        }
    }
}
```

Uncount `(...)` from `A sentence(...).`

```
{
    "rules": {
        "sentence-length": {
            "max": 100,
            "skipPatterns": [
                "/\\(.*\\)$\\./"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## A "Sentence"

This rule use [sentence-splitter](https://github.com/textlint-rule/sentence-splitter) as library.
So the definition of "Sentence" is the same as sentence-splitter.

For example, the following text is 3 sentences.

```
We are talking about pens.
He said "This is a pen. I like it".
I could relate to that statement.
```

![Example sentences](./sentence.png)

Second line includes `"..."`, but this rule treat second line as a single sentence.

If you want to ignore `"..."`, you can use `skipPatterns` option.

```
{
    "rules": {
        "sentence-length": {
            "max": 100,
            "skipPatterns": [
                "/\".*?\"/"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
